# Code Portfolio

This repository hosts a Github page which contains an overview over my code portfolio. See it rendered at [adriankoering.github.io](https://adriankoering.github.io/).

## Implementation

The page is written in markdown in a jupyter-notebook and then converted into html using jupyter-nbconvert. This is obviously overkill but it spares me from writing html manually.
