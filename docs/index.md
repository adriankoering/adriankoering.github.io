Object-oriented, test-driven development of a renderer in Python. Padvinder is meant to be a dutchly flavoured word for pathtracing; encoding the algorithm used for rendering with Guido van Rossum's dutch origins.

### [k-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier](https://github.com/adriankoering/k-nearest-neighbors-classifier)
Introducing, implementing and visualizing a k-nearest-neighbors classifier (KNN) in a jupyter-notebook directly displayed by Github.


### [Tensorflow CC Inference](https://github.com/adriankoering/tensorflow-cc-inference)
Library running inference in C++ for neural networks defined in Python using Tensorflow.

### [Classification CNN's for Image Segmentation](https://github.com/adriankoering/classification-cnns-for-segmentation)
Exploring how to use CNN's trained for image classification on the problem of (rudimentary) image segmentation.

### [Multi-Frame Noise Reduction](https://github.com/adriankoering/multi-frame-noise-reduction)
Compute an image with reduced camera noise from a stack of images taken in quick succession of the same scene.
