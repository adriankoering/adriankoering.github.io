This is an overview of my recent projects available on Github.

### [Tensorflow CC Inference](https://github.com/adriankoering/tensorflow-cc-inference)
A C++ library helping with inference / feed-forward evaluation of trained neural networks. Tested with [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and continuous integration on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/adriankoering/tensorflow-cc-inference).

### [Padvinder](https://github.com/adriankoering/padvinder)

Object-oriented, test-driven development of a renderer in Python. Unittests with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/) continuous integration on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/adriankoering/padvinder). Padvinder is meant to be a dutchly flavoured word for pathtracing; encoding the algorithm used for rendering with Guido van Rossum's dutch origins.

### [k-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier](https://github.com/adriankoering/k-nearest-neighbors-classifier)
Implementing and visualizing a k-nearest-neighbors classifier (KNN) in a jupyter-notebook rendered by Github [here](https://github.com/adriankoering/k-nearest-neighbors-classifier/blob/master/k-nearest%20neighbor%20classifier.ipynb).
